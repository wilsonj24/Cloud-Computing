### Project: Web Application Development with Cloud Computing.
### By: Jordan Wilson

# About: 
In this project, I created a web application through a virtual machine running on OpenStack. The importance of this project is to show that you can use software as a service as the web application is a service for the client to the server. This is a concept that a lot of modern day companies use such as Spotify which allows users to use the cloud in order to deliver a service and not have to download files to your local machine.


## How to run:

In order to run this project. You must have an OpenStack Account.
